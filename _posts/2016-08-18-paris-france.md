PARIS, FRANCE..!

Does the other paris have a tower thing?

Just sharing a few shots because I have plans for the rest. I hope.

So, I'm not being 'glib' about the tower thing. I know it's important historically and culturally---a beacon of liberty and equality. Now, it wasn't. It was just one of those temporary structures symbolising (I'm english, it's got an 's') and celebrating, the same job the London Eye has this side of the millennium...anyway... I, we went to Paris the wife and I right between Christmas Day and New Year's Day. Stayed in the centre, which was awesome. Walked about, which was awesome. Bought her Christmas present from Tiffany's in Rue de la Paix (which was AWESOME!), like London there's plenty of Tiffany's to choose from but we google street viewed around and thought this was the best looking. I do this, I shouldn't. Maybe I don't have enough to keep me busy.
