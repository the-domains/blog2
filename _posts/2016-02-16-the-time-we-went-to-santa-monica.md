During 2016 we're relocating to the sunshine state from sunny England... I know I know, why? I'm a photographer and want to open a studio where a lot of people want their pictures taken---that's the hope, that's the gamble. I can't wait, it's an itch, an urge that needs scratching. Back and forth we travel, accountants, business advisors, the fruitless search for a studio to lease. We've had to stop looking at houses to rent because there is always so many and they always change so rapidly. The only crazy thing so far has been the temperature last December, everything else is a dream waiting to be dreamt if you will.
