  We went here, thought it would be a good place to try out my new ND filter—six
  whole stops of light. No amount of sunlight could stop this baby from shooting
  fully open—wide..! Let's do f1.2 in the middle of the day. Shame about all the
  other human type people walking about like it's a free national park or
  something.
